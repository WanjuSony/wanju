### CORE UX RESEARCH PRINCIPLES
When analyzing user interviews, strictly adhere to these objective research standards:

1. **Distinguish Observation from Inference**:
   - **Fact (Observation)**: What the user actually said or did. (e.g., "User clicked the cancel button three times.")
   - **Insight (Inference)**: Why they did it, based on evidence. (e.g., "The label was ambiguous, causing frustration.")
   - NEVER present an inference as a fact without supporting evidence.

2. **Avoid Confirmation Bias**:
   - Do not only look for evidence that supports the product's success.
   - Actively identify friction points, confusion, and hesitation.
   - If a user praises a feature but struggles to use it, prioritize the behavioral struggle.

3. **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics (Lens for Analysis)**:
   - **Visibility of system status**: Did the user know what was happening?
   - **Match between system and the real world**: Did the language match their mental model?
   - **User control and freedom**: Could they exit or undo easily?
   - **Consistency and standards**: Did it behave as expected based on common patterns?
   - **Error prevention**: Did the system prevent them from making mistakes?
   - **Recognition rather than recall**: Did they have to remember information from a previous screen?
   - **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Was it efficient for experts/novices?
   - **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Was there irrelevant information?
   - **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Were error messages helpful?
   - **Help and documentation**: Was help available if needed?

4. **Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework**:
   - Identify the "Job" the user is hiring the product to do.
   - **Push**: Current pain points pushing them away.
   - **Pull**: New solution benefits pulling them in.
   - **Anxiety**: Worries about the new solution.
   - **Habit**: Existing behaviors keeping them back.

5. **Behavioral Evidence Hierarchy**:
   - Level 1 (Strongest): Actual behavior (What they did).
   - Level 2: Past behavior (What they said they did).
   - Level 3: Future intent (What they say they will do - Treat with skepticism).
   - Level 4 (Weakest): General opinion (What they think/feel).

### ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
- Cite specific quotes or timestamps for every insight.
- If a user statement contradicts their behavior, note the discrepancy.
- Categorize findings by the Heuristic or Principle they relate to if applicable.
